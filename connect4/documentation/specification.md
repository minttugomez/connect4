Connect Four is a game where two players take turns in placing a marker on a 7x6 grid (where 7 is the width). It is only allowed to place the marker on the lowest empty spot. Once one of the players have a line of 4 markers horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player wins.

In this project I am planning to implement minimax-algorithm to solve the problem of winning Connect Four. I will create a very simple user interface for the game of Connect 4 and focus on making the AI algorithm as well-working as possible, aiming to win against real players with as high win-rate as possible.
